IN COMPUTER SCIENCE SPECIFICALLY INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND MACHINE LEARNING THE HARMONIC MEAN OF THE PRECISION TRUE POSITIVES PER PREDICTED POSITIVE AND THE RECALL TRUE POSITIVES PER REAL POSITIVE IS OFTEN USED AS AN AGGREGATED PERFORMANCE SCORE FOR THE EVALUATION OF ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS THE FSCORE OR FMEASURE THIS IS USED IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL BECAUSE ONLY THE POSITIVE CLASS IS OF RELEVANCE WHILE NUMBER OF NEGATIVES IN GENERAL IS LARGE AND UNKNOWN IT IS THUS A TRADEOFF AS TO WHETHER THE CORRECT POSITIVE PREDICTIONS SHOULD BE MEASURED IN RELATION TO THE NUMBER OF PREDICTED POSITIVES OR THE NUMBER OF REAL POSITIVES SO IT IS MEASURED VERSUS A PUTATIVE NUMBER OF POSITIVES THAT IS AN ARITHMETIC MEAN OF THE TWO POSSIBLE DENOMINATORS A CONSEQUENCE ARISES FROM BASIC ALGEBRA IN PROBLEMS WHERE PEOPLE OR SYSTEMS WORK TOGETHER AS AN EXAMPLE IF A GASPOWERED PUMP CAN DRAIN A POOL IN HOURS AND A BATTERYPOWERED PUMP
